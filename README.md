## Usage

### Getting Started

1. Launch the application
2. Create profiles with your shipping and payment information
3. Add proxies to improve success rates and avoid IP bans
4. Create a task for the product you want to purchase
5. Start the task and monitor progress

### Task Creation

1. Navigate to the Tasks tab
2. Click "New Task"
3. Enter product URL or SKU, desired size, and quantity
4. Select a profile and proxy group
5. Configure advanced settings if needed
6. Create the task

### Proxy Setup

- Supports HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS4, and SOCKS5 proxies
- Format: `ip:port` or `ip:port:username:password`
- Group proxies for better organization and task distribution
- Test proxies against Nike servers to verify they're working

### Profile Management

- Create multiple shipping and payment profiles
- All payment data is encrypted locally
- Supports different countries and regions

## Architecture

- **Frontend:** Electron + React 18 + TailwindCSS (Vite-powered)
- **Backend as a Service:** Supabase (PostgreSQL database, Auth, API, Storage)
- **API:** Supabase client SDK for all database and authentication operations
- **Encryption:** AES-256-GCM for local sensitive data

> SneakerBot now uses Supabase for all persistent storage, user authentication, and real-time data sync. No local SQLite or Playwright automation is used in this version.

2. Get your project URL and anon key from Settings > API
3. Create the following tables in your Supabase database:

```sql
-- Table: profiles
create table profiles (
    id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id uuid references auth.users(id) on delete cascade,
    name text not null,
    email text not null,
    billing_info jsonb,
    shipping_info jsonb,
    card_token text,
    created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc', now()) not null
);

-- Table: tasks
create table tasks (
    id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
    site text not null,
    product_url text not null,
    size text,
    quantity int,
    profile_id uuid references profiles(id) on delete cascade,
    status text,
    created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc', now()) not null
);
```

4. Update your `.env.local` file with your Supabase credentials
